> A secure desktop password manager with multi-user support, built with Python and CustomTkinter. All data is encrypted and stored locally on your computer.

## üéØ About

The **Desktop Password Vault** is an open-source application created to offer a secure and offline solution for password management. The main motivation is to give the user full control over their data, without depending on third-party cloud services.

The project uses **Python** as its foundation, with a graphical user interface developed using the **CustomTkinter** library. Security is the central pillar, implemented with the **Cryptography** library, which ensures that all information is stored securely through key derivation (PBKDF2HMAC) and symmetric encryption (Fernet).

## ‚ú® Features

-   ‚úÖ **Strong Encryption:** Uses a unique salt per user, PBKDF2HMAC to derive a secure key from the master password, and Fernet (128-bit AES in CBC mode) to encrypt the data.
-   ‚úÖ **Multi-User Support:** Allows different users to create their own password-protected profiles in the same application, with completely separate password vaults.
-   ‚úÖ **100% Local Storage:** All profiles and encrypted data are saved directly on your machine. No information is sent over the internet.
-   ‚úÖ **Modern GUI:** A user-friendly and intuitive interface built with the CustomTkinter library.
-   ‚úÖ **Simple Management:** Add new credentials (website, username, and password), list all saved passwords, and copy them to the clipboard with a single click.
